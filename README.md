# Argile

Argile is a barebones tool for managing Agile projects written using Angular and Firebase. 

## Motivation

This tool is an experiment in rapid delivery for javascript apps. I'm a fan of Agile, but most free tools are lacking and the only enterprise solution I've used seems too cumbersome for smaller teams.
